description: Add TableCalendar to your Flutter project
---

Get started with TableCalendar by adding it to your Flutter project. The package is available on pub.dev and requires Flutter SDK 3.0.0 or higher.

## Add the dependency

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your pubspec.yaml file">
    Navigate to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file in the root directory.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add table_calendar to dependencies">
    Add the following line under the `dependencies` section:
    
    ```yaml pubspec.yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      table_calendar: ^3.1.3
    ```
    
    <Info>
      The `^` symbol means your project will use version 3.1.3 or any compatible version with non-breaking changes.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install the package">
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
    
    This downloads the package and its dependencies to your project.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Import the package">
    In your Dart file, import TableCalendar:
    
    ```dart
    import 'package:table_calendar/table_calendar.dart';
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional dependencies

TableCalendar automatically includes the following dependencies:

- **intl** (^0.20.1) - For internationalization and date formatting
- **simple_gesture_detector** (^0.2.0) - For gesture handling

You don't need to add these manually, but you may need to initialize date formatting if you plan to use locales.

## Locale support setup (optional)

If you want to display the calendar in different languages, you'll need to initialize date formatting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure intl package is available">
    The `intl` package is already included as a dependency of TableCalendar, so you don't need to add it separately.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initialize date formatting">
    Modify your `main.dart` file to initialize date formatting before running your app:
    
    ```dart main.dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'package:intl/date_symbol_data_local.dart';
    
    void main() {
      initializeDateFormatting().then((_) => runApp(MyApp()));
    }
    
    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return MaterialApp(
          title: 'TableCalendar Demo',
          home: MyHomePage(),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      This initialization step is only required if you plan to use the `locale` property to display the calendar in different languages.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Version requirements

<Note>
  - **Flutter SDK**: 3.0.0 or higher
  - **Dart SDK**: Compatible with Flutter 3.0.0+
  - **Current version**: 3.1.3
</Note>

## Verify installation

To verify that TableCalendar is installed correctly, try importing it in a Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:table_calendar/table_calendar.dart';

void main() {
  // If this compiles without errors, installation was successful
  print('TableCalendar is installed!');
}
```

Run `flutter analyze` to check for any import errors:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Package not found error">
    If you see an error that the package cannot be found:
    
    1. Make sure you saved `pubspec.yaml` after editing
    2. Run `flutter pub get` again
    3. Try `flutter clean` followed by `flutter pub get`
    4. Restart your IDE/editor
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version conflict errors">
    If you encounter dependency conflicts:
    
    1. Check that your Flutter SDK version is 3.0.0 or higher by running `flutter --version`
    2. Update Flutter if needed: `flutter upgrade`
    3. Try using a specific version instead of `^3.1.3` if conflicts persist
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Import errors">
    If the import statement shows an error:
    
    1. Ensure `flutter pub get` completed successfully
    2. Check that your IDE has indexed the new package (this may take a moment)
    3. Restart your IDE/editor
    4. Try running `flutter pub cache repair`
  </Accordion>
